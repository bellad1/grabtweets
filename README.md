GrabTweets
===========

Introduction
------------

These functions are used to collect tweets from a particular user, relying primarily on
[twitty](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34837-twitty) by 
[Vladimir
Bondarenko](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1421693-vladimir-bondarenko) on MathWorks.

The purpose of this repo is mainly to familiarize myself with Git. One day I may actually know
things.
